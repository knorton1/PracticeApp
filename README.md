App Description
This is my first attempt at iOS/swift coding. I followed the pre-work tutorial from codepaths iOS development course. 
The app asks for your first, last, and school name. It also asks how many pets(dogs) you have and if you want more. 
Once you hit the introduction button at the bottom it will send an alert to the phone printing all of your information back to you. 

App Walk-though
TODO:// Add the URL to your animated app walk-though gif in the image tag below. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README.
(☝️ Remove this paragraph after after adding gif). LICEcap is a great tool for recording and you can simply upload the gif to GitHub and provide the path name in place of URL as shown below.
